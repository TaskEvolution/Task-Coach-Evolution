Release 1.3.19 - October 7, 2012
This is a mixed feature and bugfix release.

Bugs fixed:
- Format times in the calendar view according to the user's preferences.
  (SF#3563441)
- Do not automatically give focus to the subject field in the task editor on
  Linux (it overwrites the X clipboard). (SF#3539452)
- After loading a task file, tasks would not become due soon on time.
  (SF#3562925)
- On OS X, the first entry in an editor page would not be automatically
  selected. (SF#3562922)
- On Linux, drag and drop of email messages from Evolution didn't work.
  (SF#3562808)
- With autosaving on, Task Coach would actually save too often. (SF#3562836)
- On Ubuntu, a file was missing causing Task Coach not to start. (SF#3562695)
- On Ubuntu, the native text control doesn't support undo and redo, added a
  home grown version. (SF#3563376)
- Don't silently adjust dates of parent and child tasks. See also the changed
  feature below. (SF#3561465, SF#3564794)
- Remember whether the "make this snooze time the default snooze time for
  future reminders" check box was checked in the reminder dialog. (SF#3567139)
- The task viewer would not refresh at midnight.
- On Windows with some locale settings, Task Coach would crash trying to
  render dates. (SF#1306)

Features added:
- In addition to specifying a maximum number of recurrences, it is now also
  possible to specify an end date for recurrence. If both an end date and a
  maximum number of recurrences are specified, recurrence stops when the first
  of both conditions is met.
- Put a link to our IndieGoGo campaign on the toolbar of the main window. The
  link will disappear when the campaign is over.

Features changed:
- Task Coach no longer enforces that the dates of child tasks lie between the
  dates of its parent task. Previously, if the start date of a child task
  would be made earlier than the start date of its parent task, Task Coach
  would silently make the start of the parent task equal to the start date of
  the child task. The same for the due date: setting the due date of the
  parent task earlier than the due date of a child task would silently change
  the due date of the child tasks if their due date would otherwise become
  later than the due date of the parent task. When viewing tasks in the task
  tree viewer, collapsing a task with child tasks will show recursive dates
  when relevant. This means that the planned start date column will show the
  earliest start date of the task itself and all of its child tasks. If the
  earliest start date is the start date of one of the child tasks, the date
  will be shown between brackets. Likewise, the actual start date column will
  show the earliest actual start date of the task and all of its child tasks.
  The due date column and the completion date column will show the latest
  date of the parent and child tasks combined. When sorting on a date
  column, the recursive value is used for sorting. So when sorting ascending
  by due date a parent task without due date but with a child task due today
  will sort before a task that is due tomorrow. This change makes the date
  behavior consistent with priorities and other attributes.
- New viewers will open floating so that is easier to put them in the position
  you want. Hopefully this will also make it more obvious for new users that
  viewers can be reordered any way they like since moving a floating viewer
  will show the docking guides.
- Clicking outside an inplace editor now accepts the changes instead of
  discarding them.
- On Windows, both left clicking and left double clicking the Task Coach icon
  in the notification area (often called the system tray) will raise or
  minimize the main window (in accordance with http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-
  us/library/windows/desktop/aa511448.aspx#interaction).

Release 1.3.18 - August 28, 2012
This is a mixed feature and bugfix release.

Team change:
- We're happy to announce that Aaron Wolf joined the Task Coach team. Aaron is
  already doing a great job scrutinizing the large number of feature requests
  we have open on http://taskcoach.uservoice.com. In addition, he is helping
  us testing Task Coach and ironing out as many bugs as we can, see the first
  results below. Furthermore, he is planning to develop an in-app tutorial
  for Task Coach so we're glad to have him on board. Welcome, Aaron!

Bugs fixed:
- Get rid of the infamous "AttributeError: __onDead" error (SF#3546400)
- Do not automatically give focus to the subject field in the task editor on
  Linux (it overwrites the X clipboard). (SF#3539452)

- When the language is set to English/US, use 12 hour clock in task and
  effort dialogs instead of 24 hour clock.
- Don't reset the edit dialog layout for editing single items after editing
  multiple items at the same time. (SF#3559292)
- When changing the "Mark task completed when all children are
  completed?"-setting in the "Progress" tab of the task edit dialog, Task
  Coach would set the percentage complete slider in the "Progress" tab to the
  recursive percentage complete while the slider is meant to only display and
  change the percentage complete of the task itself. (SF#3559740)
- When a task with subtasks does not override the global setting for marking a
  task completed when all of its subtasks are completed, actually use that
  setting when displaying the percentage complete of the parent task in the
  task viewer. (SF#3559740)
- The settings for the viewers in the edit dialogs (such as the visible
  columns in the effort tab and the notes tab) wouldn't be consistently
  applied to each edit dialog. (SF#3559057)

- The combobox for selecting the snooze time in the reminder dialog was not
  read only. This suggested that one could type in custom snooze times while
  that is not supported (yet). (SF#3560416)
- The "Filter on all checked categories/Filter on any checked category" option
  was only available via the toolbar of the category viewer. Due to the width
  of the option, it could be difficult to access. The option is now also
  available as menu item in the View->Filter menu. (SF#3554627)
- When the budget left is negative, the budget left field in the task edit
  dialog would not show a minus sign. (SF#3554616)
- On Mac OS X, the tip of the day window would block the dialog for unlocking
  a locked task file. (SF#3561499)
- When saving selected tasks, not only include the categories the selected
  tasks belong to, but also the parent categories of the used categories, even
  though they may not have been used themselves. (SF#3561159)
- When creating a new item, set focus to the subject field so that the
  description tab is raised if needed. (SF#3561515)

  'https:', 'ftp:', etc.) would result in attachments that couldn't be opened.
  (SF#3561889)
- On Linux, dropping of URLs didn't work. (SF#3561889)
- The order of tabs in edit dialogs wouldn't be restored correctly after it
  had been changed by the user. (SF#3562239)

  item and multi-item dialogs. (SF#3562239)

- In the calendar view, unplanned dates are now cropped to the current day.
- Add support for Thunderbird IMAP accounts that use NTLM authentication
  (typically Exchange accounts).
- When starting up, Task Coach checks for messages from the Task Coach
  developers. This allows us to reach all users for e.g. notifications on
  critical bugs or requests for support. Each message is displayed only once
  and the display of messages can be turned off completely. This feature will
  be used sparingly, of course.
- Added almost complete Belarusian translation thanks to Korney San.
- Allow for changing the font used in the description field of edit dialogs.
  The font can be changed in the editor tab of the preferences dialog. Patch
  supplied by Nicola Chiapolini.

  dates and times when the language is Norsk. (SF#1820497)
- On Mac OS X, the shortcut to email a task is now Shift-Cmd-M instead of
  Cmd-M (which is the system shortcut to minimize the active window).
  (SF#3489341)
- Don't escape characters on Mac OS X when emailing a task. (SF#3489341)

Features added:
- In task viewers, late tasks, due soon tasks, and over due tasks can be
  hidden. It was already possible to hide inactive tasks, active tasks, and
  completed tasks. This makes it possible to create a task viewer that only
  shows e.g. due soon tasks or late tasks, or any combination of task
  statuses.
- Add an option to disable session management on GTK. The XFCE session manager
  causes Task Coach to hang randomly on start.
- On Mac OS X and Linux (with espeak installed), reminders can be spoken.
  This can be turned on in the preferences dialog, on the task reminder tab.

  (based on the earliest effort). (SF#3478684, SF#3479444)
- Marking an inactive task active wouldn't properly update the task icon from
  grey to blue. (SF#3479444)

  (SF#3452446)
- On Windows, when users try to save the task file in a folder where they

- The language choice control in the preferences dialog would always show

  easier than from 3D pie charts. (SF#3441469)
- On Windows, the Edit menu could become very wide if the user would edit a
  long subject. (SF# 3441474)
- When the user edits the reminder date and time and it is in the past, don't

  to finish changing the reminder date and time into a future date and time.
  (SF#3441442)
- Make sure the edit dialogs are by default big enough to show all controls.
  (SF#3441783)

Release 1.3.0 - November 20, 2011
This release makes all edits done in dialogs immediate.

Bugs fixed:
- It was and is possible to open multiple edit dialogs for the same item. With
  earlier releases of Task Coach, the last edit dialog closed would overwrite
  changes made with edit dialogs that were closed earlier. With the new edit
  dialog functionality introduced in this release, changes are propagated
  immediately to all open dialogs. This will prevent overwriting changes made
  in other dialogs. (SF#1152561)

  (SF#3424138)
- When editing start or due date inline, Task Coach would ignore the

- If there is no user input for some (configurable) time, Task coach now asks
  what to do with tracked efforts when the user comes back.

  before showing them as active. (SF#3085362)

- When changing a date/time inline, hitting enter in the date part of the
  control would close the inline control, but not change the date.

  start and end of working day. (SF#3431160)

  into account when sorting by categories, prerequisites or dependencies.
  (SF#3414914)
- Don't reset the percentage complete to 0 when the user changes it from 100
  to some other percentage less than 100.
- Fix a memory leak when opening edit dialogs.

Features added:
- The task viewer in list mode now also shows the categories, prerequisites
  and dependencies inherited from parent tasks, between parentheses. In
  addition, the inherited categories, prerequisites or dependencies are taken
  into account when sorting by categories, prerequisites or dependencies.

- When the priority field gets focus, select all priority digits so the user
  can simply type a new number to overwrite the previous one. (SF#3411384)

- When editing multiple tasks at the same time, changing the priority would
  not automatically check the priority checkbox. (SF#3414423)

Release 1.2.11 - March 10, 2011
This is a mixed bugfix and feature release.

Bugs fixed:

  be wrong. (SF#3146576)
- On Windows, the icons of the undo and redo menu items would disappear after
  their first use.

Features added:
- Import tasks from CSV file.
- In addition to hiding all completed tasks, it is now also possible to hide
  completed tasks but keep recently completed tasks visible for a limited
  amount of time. This can be done by hiding tasks that were completed before
  today, before yesterday, before the current week or before the current
  month, using the View->Filter menu. (http://uservoice.com/a/lZ8ss)
- In addition to hiding all future tasks, it is now also possible to hide
  future tasks but still show future tasks that will become active in a short
  while. This can be done by hiding future tasks that start today, tomorrow,
  next week or next month, using the View->Filter menu.

Features changed:
- Keyboard shortcut improvements: On Windows and Linux, the keyboard shortcut
  for adding a task is now simply Insert. A new subtask can be added with
  Shift-Insert. On Mac OS X, the Insert shortcut doesn't work for some reason
  so there a new task can be added with Cmd-N and a new subtask with Shift-
  Cmd-N. The Delete keyboard shortcut works for all viewers. Notes can be
  added to tasks and categories with the Ctrl-B keyboard shortcut. Tasks and
  notes can be mailed with the Ctrl-M keyboard shortcut. Attachments can be
  added with the Shift-Ctrl-A keyboard shortcut and all attachments of an
  item can be opened with the Shift-Ctrl-O keyboard shortcut.
- Rearranged the menu's: Instead of a Task, Category, Effort and Note menu,
  there are now a New menu for creating new items and an Actions menu for
  applying actions such as marking a task completed, mailing an item and
  starting and stopping effort tracking. The Edit and Delete menu items are
  now placed in the Edit menu.

Distribution changed:
- Task Coach was added to the Ports collection of FreeBSD thanks to Kevin Lo.
  See the download section of the Task Coach website.

  working.
- The viewer background color would not obey the global user setting.

- Task files wouldn't specify the encoding in the XML header, making it harder
  to process them with other tools. (SF#3182504)
- In the calendar viewer, use the completion date as end date when a task is
  completed. (SF#3183086)

Features added:
- Efforts are filtered by categories like tasks and notes.

  effort is being tracked will resume tracking for the task that was last
  being tracked. (http://uservoice.com/a/cXLhb)
- Start tracking effort and stop/resume tracking effort have keyboard
  shortcuts: Ctrl-T for start tracking effort and Shift-Ctrl-T for
  stop/resume tracking effort. (http://uservoice.com/a/9hhaE)
- Clear all filters via a keyboard shortcut: Shift-Ctrl-F
  (http://uservoice.com/a/4Tt4T)
- Support for CRAM-MD5 authentication when dropping IMAP mails from

  toolbar search control. Hitting Escape when the toolbar search control has
  keyboard focus moves the focus back to the viewer. Hitting Ctrl-Down when
  the toolbar search control has keyboard focus pops up the search control
  menu. (http://uservoice.com/a/6fW73)

- The effort viewer now has "Start tracking effort" and "Stop tracking
  effort" buttons on the toolbar. The "Start tracking effort" starts tracking
  effort for the task(s) of the selected effort(s). This enables you to
  quickly resume tracking the most recent task by selecting the topmost effort
  record and hit the "Start tracking effort" button. The "Stop tracking
  effort" button simply does what it says and was added for consistencies
  sake. (http://uservoice.com/a/fHSAX)

Release 1.2.2 - November 6, 2010
This release adds a template edit dialog and fixes some bugs.

Bugs fixed:
- Type indicator of attachments in the attachment tab of edit dialogs was
  missing. (SF#3087177)
- After editing the subject of a composite task in the task list viewer (e.g.
  changing 'Project A' into 'Project B'), also update the subjects of the
  subtasks (e.g. 'Project A -> Task 1' should update to 'Project B -> Task
  1').
- When editing a subject of a subtask in the task list viewer inline, don't
  include the subjects of its ancestors in the text control.
- When filtering on categories, don't show tasks whose subtasks (that belong
  to the filtered categories) are all hidden by another filter.
- When double clicking in the calendar viewer (when it is in vertical month
  mode) to create a new task, set the due date of the new task to the end of
  the day. This makes sure the new task is visible in the calendar after
  closing the task edit dialog. (SF#3103011)
- Include end of work day as option when selecting a time in the effort edit
  dialog. (http://uservoice.com/a/380R8)
- Remember column widths in the category viewer across sessions.

Features added:
- Don't ask for a name when creating a new template. There is now a template
  edit dialog; one can only delete templates though.
  (http://uservoice.com/a/4Ntz6)
- Allow the user to change the ordering of templates

Distribution changed:
- Added support for Fedora 14. (SF#3101814)


Release 1.2.1 - October 16, 2010
This is a bugfix release.

Bugs fixed:
- Don't refuse to open a task file when it is sorted on a "total" column.
  (SF#3085056)
- Don't expand tasks in the prerequisite tab when opening a task dialog, it's
  really slow. (SF#3085358)
- Always display the month name in the horizontal monthly calendar view.
  (SF#3062505)
- Allow the user to resize columns in horizontal calendar view (SF#3062505)
- Reset percentage complete when recurring a task.
- When using relative paths for attachments, attachments couldn't be opened
  from the attachments tab in the edit dialog. (SF#3087177)


Release 1.2.0 - October 9, 2010
This release adds task dependencies.

Bugs fixed:
- An exception would be thrown if search strings contained a percentage
  symbol.
- When printing, correctly align columns.
- Show sort indicator in attachment viewers.
- Task Coach would always change budget, hourly fee, and fixed fee to zero
  when mass editing tasks. (SF#3081666)
- Better contrast in the calendar view (SF#3072138)
- Tasks started at 00:00 would be displayed twice in the monthly vertical
  calendar view (SF#3062501)

Feature added:
- Tasks can have one or more prerequisite tasks. As long as a task has one or
  more prerequisite tasks that are not completed, the dependent task is
  inactive. The task tree viewer has two extra columns, one for showing
  prerequisite tasks and one for showing dependent tasks. Prerequisite tasks
  can be selected in the Prerequisites tab of the task edit dialog. Dependent
  tasks cannot be selected explicitly but are simply derived from the
  prerequisite tasks. For example, if task B can be started only after task A
  has been completed, task A is called a prerequisite for task B and task B
  is called a dependency of task A.

Features changed:
- To simplify the application and reduce the number of columns all "total"
  and "overall" columns have been removed. For composite items that have
  children, the tree viewers show the "total" or "overall" value when the
  item is collapsed and the individual value when the item is not collapsed.
  An example may help: suppose task A has a budget of 20 hours and subtask A1
  has a budget of 10 hours. In the task viewer in tree mode, the budget
  column shows 20 hours for task A when it is expanded and 30 hours when it
  is collapsed. For task A1 the budget shown is always 10 hour. In list mode,
  the task viewer shows the individual values, so a budget of 20 hours for
  task A and 10 hours for task A1.
- The order of tabs in tabbed dialogs can be changed. Task Coach now
  remembers the order of the tabs in the item edit dialogs and the
  preferences dialog. (http://uservoice.com/a/oa7jx)
- When printing, show the sorted column by underlining the column header.
- Reorganized some menu items differently and added mnemonics to all menu
  items.

Implementation changed:
- The task file format was changed to support task dependencies. The task
  file format version number is now 31.


Release 1.1.4 - September 30, 2010
This is a bugfix release.

Bugs fixed:
- Task Coach would not properly use the system's locale to select the language
  if the language was set to 'Let the system determine the language',
  resulting in the wrong language being used. (SF#3064566)
- Don't switch top/bottom and left/right margins in the print preview.
- Refresh task viewer filters every minute so that when the task viewer is
  hiding inactive tasks, inactive tasks that become active also become
  visible. (SF#3072013)
- Displaying revenue in effort viewers was slow. The effort viewer has a
  revenue column that shows the revenue earned per effort record. Until now,
  this would be the task fee per hour times the duration of the effort record
  plus the part of the fixed fee of the task earned with this effort record.
  So if a task had a fixed fee of 1000,- and you had spent 10 hours on the
  task, an effort record of one hour would have a revenue of 100,-. However,
  calculating all this would get slow for larger amounts of effort records,
  so the effort revenue now only shows the variable part, i.e. fee per hour
  times effort duration. (SF#3056540)
- In the situation where Task Coach was started minimized in the system tray
  and with the setting "Hide window when minimizing" turned on, the main
  window would not be hidden when minimizing it. (SF#3077271)

Features added:
- Allow hiding composite tasks in calendar view.
  (http://uservoice.com/a/aul3S)
- In the tree/list task viewer, allow additional selection with Cmd-click on
  Mac OS X.


Release 1.1.3 - September 10, 2010
This is a bugfix release.

Bugs fixed:
- When closing a edit dialog, don't delete the category, note, and attachment
  viewers in the dialog before the data has been processed. (SF#3059143)
- The PortableApps platform would override the language selected by the user
  in Task Coach. (SF#2965342, SF#3059429)
- When retrieving the latest available Task Coach version number from the Task
  Coach website doesn't work, simply ignore that.
- Don't crash when searching efforts with "Include subitems" turned on.

Feature added:
- When selecting the language in the preferences dialog, you can select 'Let
  the system determine the language'. If you're using the PortableApps
  version of Task Coach and the PortableApps platform, the PortableApps
  platform language will be used. Otherwise, Task Coach will let your system's
  locale determine the language.


Release 1.1.2 - September 2, 2010
This is a bugfix release.

Bugs fixed:
- Task Coach wouldn't run on Ubuntu 9.04. This is because Task Coach tried to
  use a feature from wxPython 2.8.9.2 while Ubuntu 9.04 ships with wxPython
  2.8.9.1. (SF#3054431)
- Only close edit dialogs when the edited item is really deleted, not when the
  item is hidden by a filter. (SF#3042880)
- Refresh filtered task viewers at midnight to properly show tasks that
  become active. (SF#3035384)
- The checkbox for mutually exclusive subcategories in the category editor
  would be unchecked even if a category had exclusive subcategories.


Release 1.1.1 - August 26, 2010
This is a bugfix release.

Bugs fixed:
- On Mac OS X, properly read task files when the font description cannot be
  parsed. This may happen when reading a task file that was last saved on a
  different platform. Unfortunately, font specifications are platform
  specific. (SF#3047183)
- Prevent exception when reading old task files.
- Saving of templates didn't work, resulting in invalid template files that
  would in turn prevent Task Coach from starting properly. (SF#3052090)
- On Windows, the tabs of the dialogs would flicker when moving the mouse over
  the tabs.
- Use dialogs for reminders. (SF#3050445)


Release 1.1.0 - August 20, 2010
This release adds time to start, due and completion dates of tasks and adds
support for mass editing of items. It also adds support for the upcoming
version 3.0 for the iPhone/iPod/iPad.

Bugs fixed:
- Icons in edit dialogs would be lined up vertically on some versions of
  Windows XP. Fixed by using a notebook widget instead of the listbook widget.
  (SF#2927384)
- The new edit dialogs better support tabbing through the dialogs.
  (SF#2687959)
- On Mac OS X, the tabs in the editor and preferences dialogs were too small.
- Searching descriptions wasn't working in the effort viewer. (SF#3031411)

Features added:
- The start, due and completion dates of tasks now also include a time. When
  reading old task files, Task Coach adds a default time to tasks: start
  dates get a time of "00:00", due dates and completion dates get a time of
  "23:59". (http://uservoice.com/a/nd3mH)
- Mass editing of items. When editing multiple items (tasks, notes, etc.),
  the edit dialog allows for selectively changing attributes of all edited
  items. (http://uservoice.com/a/ahxq8)
- Less intrusive notifications (reminders).
- The calendar orientation can be changed.
- Add an option to the calendar viewer to show all tasks but those which have
  no start nor due date (SF#3008517)
- The headers in the calendar view are now always visible.
  (http://uservoice.com/a/irtQs)
- The calendar view can show an arbitrary number of periods (except months).
  (http://uservoice.com/a/5F5Ka)

Implementation changed:
- The task file format was changed to support start, due and completion date
  and time. The task file format version number is now 30.


Release 1.0.10 - August 15, 2010
This is a bugfix release.

Bugs fixed:
- When SyncML was on, the effort viewer would show effort for deleted tasks.
- When dragging panes and dropping them onto each other to create an automatic
  notebook, make sure dropped viewers are properly contained in the notebook.
- When renaming a viewer, apply the new name to the active viewer.
  (SF#3042037)

Feature added:
- Allow automatic creation of a notebook of viewers on top of the initial task
  viewer. This makes the user interface functionally equivalent to the
  previously removed "tabbed" mode.


Release 1.0.9 - August 8, 2010
This is a bugfix release.

Bugs fixed:
- On Windows, Task Coach wouldn't start when the user interface was in
  "tabbed" mode. (SF#3041123)
- On Windows, toolbar items that should trigger a popup menu (e.g. templates)
  wouldn't.
- On Windows, disabled toolbar buttons wouldn't be greyed out.

Feature removed:
- The "tabbed" user interface mode has been removed. Having two different
  user interfaces makes it harder to test changes that affect the user
  interface, as evidenced by a bug in the previous release.


Release 1.0.8 - August 6, 2010
This is a bugfix release.

Bugs fixed:
- Drop support for SyncML on Debian; too many architectures/versions to
  support.

- Refresh filter for tasks due today/tomorrow/etc. at midnight. (SF#3035384)
- On Linux, when selecting an effort in the effort viewer with the mouse also
  give keyboard focus to the effort viewer. (SF#3039519)


Release 1.0.7 - July 2, 2010

  (SF#2992853, SF#2992850, SF#2992848)
- On Mac OS X, don't cut text in text controls when users type <cmd><shift>X,
  only when they type <cmd>X. (SF#2942288)
- Properly save the task file when the font name contains non-ascii
  characters. (SF#3014110)
- Correctly export tasks and effort to vCalendar (.ics) when they contain non-
  ascii characters. (SF#3016528)


Release 1.0.5 - June 8, 2010
This is a bugfix release.

Bugs fixed:
- Task Coach would fail to save the task file correctly, when it couldn't
  read temporary files for email attachments. (SF#2369711)
- Don't crash when using a purple folder or led icon. (SF#3009432)
- Don't allow exporting efforts to iCalendar when effort viewer is in
  aggregate mode, it would result in an empty .ics file. (SF#2935616)

Release 0.78.3 - January 31, 2010
This is a bugfix release.

Bugs fixed:
- Free up resources (user objects and memory) on Windows when closing dialogs.
  The memory leak was caused by popup menu's in dialogs not being deleted.

reminder dialog, makes other small changes and fixes some bugs.

Bugs fixed:
- Make file locking work on Windows computers that have a hostname with non-
  ASCII characters in it. (SF#2904864)
- Avoid deploying UxTheme.dll because it causes problems on 64-bits Windows
  systems. (SF#2911280, SF#2897639, SF#2886396)
- Correctly refresh task square map and task time line viewers after stopping
  effort tracking, i.e. stop showing the clock icon on the previously tracked
  task.
- When maximizing and restoring panes (viewers), don't change the order.
  (SF#2922952)
- Slightly faster redrawing of task viewers after sorting or filtering.
- In some circumstances, synchronization with an iPhone/iPod Touch device

  notes and attachments that don't have their own font use the font of the
  categories they belong to. Effort records use the font of the task they
  belong to.
- In addition to the background color, the foreground (text) color of tasks,
  categories, notes and attachments can now also be changed. Tasks, notes and
  attachments that don't have their own foreground color use the foreground
  color of the categories they belong to. Effort records use the foreground
  color of the task they belong to.
- Added Ctrl+E keyboard shortcut to "New effort..." menu item.
- Reminder dialogs have an extra button to mark the task completed.
  (http://uservoice.com/a/5HVq3)
- The snooze times offered by the reminder dialog can be configured via the
  preferences dialog.

Features changed:

  to keep the remaining backups spread evenly across time.
  (http://uservoice.com/a/5FrtF)
- Merged the four menu items for exporting tasks and effort to iCalendar and
  vCalendar formats into two menu items.

- Don't open effort viewer contex (right-click) menu twice on every right-
  click. (SF#2902389)

  to whom. (http://uservoice.com/a/tvOIS)
- F2 can be used to start in-line editing of the subject of a task, category
  or note. (http://uservoice.com/a/9pLUT)
- Added partial Mongolian translation.


Release 0.76.1 - November 13, 2009

  enabled, this disables two other features: snooze/don't snooze and open task
  on reminder.

  task viewer that only displays completed tasks.
  (http://uservoice.com/a/NQCUV)


Release 0.76.0 - November 7, 2009
This release adds buttons on the toolbar of task viewers to hide completed
and/or future tasks, makes subjects editable in-line, removes a couple of
silly features, and fixes some bugs.

Bugs fixed:
- Iterating over viewers wasn't working in tabbed mode.
- When merging a task file with categories, don't break the links between
  tasks/notes and categories. (SF#2882493)
- Tree viewers wouldn't properly refresh when an attribute of a task,
  category, or note was changed to be empty. (SF#2806354)

  day/week/month) were not being updated every second.
- Tabs in the tabbed window layout could not be closed.
- Don't complain when the system locale has a thousands separator that
  consists of more than one character. (SF#2889931, SF#2888714)

Features added:
- Task viewers now have buttons on the toolbar to hide or show completed
  and/or inactive (future) tasks. (http://uservoice.com/a/EfkNL)

- Double clicking the task bar icon will iconize the main window when it is
  visible and restore it when iconized (Mac OS X and Windows).
  (http://uservoice.com/a/dKfBt)

This is a bugfix release that fixes some user interface bugs, most notably
that entering dates with the keyboard was not working on Mac OS X and Linux.

Bugs fixed:
- Typing in time controls (effort start and stop, reminder) didn't work on Mac
  OS X. (SF#2798239)
- Prevent the locked file dialog and the new version notification dialog of
  blocking each other on Mac OS X.
- When using the context menu of a selected effort record to create a new
  effort record use the task of the selected effort record as task of the new
  effort record as well. (SF#2873933)
- After expanding all items (Shift+Ctrl+E), keep items expanded even when sort
  order changes or tasks are completed. (SF#2841854)
- The "Open all attachments" menu item was always disabled. (SF#2874180)

- Task Coach wouldn't start when using the tabbed main window mode on Mac OS
  X. (SF#2867585)


Release 0.74.2 - September 25, 2009
This is a bugfix release that fixes several minor bugs and increases
performance.

Bugs fixed:
- iPhone synchronization: when doing a full refresh from desktop, categories
  parents could be mismatched.
- A bug in the task filter would cause tasks to be shown that were supposed to
  be hidden. (SF#2841854)
- The filter submenu would sometimes be in the wrong state (enabled or
  disabled).
- On Linux, locking two task files in the same folder, e.g. when merging,
  would make Task Coach think that its task file was locked by another
  instance of Task Coach. (SF#2852216)
- Performance improvements. Task Coach still isn't super fast, but at least
  performance should be a bit better now. (SF#2807678, SF#2683002)

Features added:
- Add an option to avoid uploading completed tasks to the iPhone/iPod Touch
  when synchronizing. For people who hide completed tasks, this can make the
  synchronization much quicker.

  another directory.
- In the attachment viewer, display a red icon for files attachments when the
  file does not exist. Also prevent the user from trying to open it.

  default profile.


Release 0.74.0 - August 16, 2009
This release adds better HTML export, a winPenPack version of Task Coach, and
fixes some bugs. Task Coach now uses Uservoice.com for feature requests.

Bugs fixed:
- Avoid nested syncml tags in the XML task file (SF#2832062, SF#2813816)

- Translate tip window and search controls on Windows. (SF#2825463)

Features added:
- When exporting data to an HTML file, Task Coach writes a simple CSS
  stylesheet alongside it. The CSS stylesheet can be edited by the user using
  a text editor; Task Coach won't overwrite it.

  considered 'soon' can now be set via the preferences dialog, in the task
  behavior tab. (SF#1312000)

Distribution changed:
- Added a winPackPen (http://www.winpackpen.com) portable package to the set
  of available distributions.

Website change:
- We're now using http://taskcoach.uservoice.com for feature requests. The
  big advantage of Uservoice over the Sourceforge feature request tracker is
  that Uservoice allows for voting. Because we have over 250 open feature
  requests on Sourceforge, it is not possible for us to move all feature
  requests ourselves. People that submitted a feature request on Sourceforge
  will receive a notification and a request to help us move their request(s)
  to Uservoice. (index.html)


Release 0.73.4 - August 6, 2009

  --help" on the command line for more information.
- Load a .po file (a file containing translations) with a command line
  option. Type "taskcoach[.py|.exe] --help" on the command line for more

- Added largely incomplete Bosnian and Basque translations. Please help make
  these translations complete. See http://www.taskcoach.org/i18n.html.


Release 0.72.10 - June 9, 2009
This is a bugfix release.

Bugs fixed:
- When opening a task edit dialog, the priority field would not show the
  priority until the up or down button was clicked (Mac OS X only).
- When opening a locked file, Task Coach would hang (Mac OS X only).
- Require wxPython 2.8.9.1 instead of 2.8.9.2 in the Debian package file
  (.deb) because Ubuntu 9.04 is still shipping 2.8.9.1 (Ubuntu only).
  (SF#2798457)
- Fix drag and drop from Outlook (Windows only). (SF#2803013)
- When logging off or shutting down the computer save unsaved changes (Linux
  only).
- When using SyncML the task file could get corrupted.

  title.
- Smaller task edit dialog to cater for lower resolution screens.

- Dragging email from a Thunderbird client that uses Gmail as IMAP server
  didn't work.

  (SF#2679544, SF#2214043)

Features added:
- All export options can now also export selected items only.

- Draw check boxes instead of black squares in the category viewer on Windows
  XP and Vista with the classic theme.

  drop down as well. (SF#2792160)

Dependency changed:

Bug fix release.

Bugs fixed:
- Allow Task Coach to be installed on Ubuntu 7.10. (SF#2117477)

- When the notes feature is turned off, hide the 'Create new note' menu item
  in the category pop up menu.
- Fixed a translation bug. (SF#2087395)
- Hide/show the main window with one click on the task bar icon instead of a
  double click (Linux only).
- The Task Coach main window would get a very small size if it was started
  minimized and had not been restored in the previous session. (SF#2052910)


Release 0.70.3 - August 17, 2008
Bug fix release.

Bugs fixed:
- wxPython 2.8.8.1 generates images in a new, backwards incompatible way,
  even when told not to do that. This bug affects users that have an older
  version of wxPython installed and use one of the Linux packages. Fixed by
  adding the relevant pieces from wxPython 2.8.8.1 to the Task Coach sources.
  (SF#2046084)
- Opening a new task viewer didn't work. (SF#2053008)
- Closing effort viewers causes exceptions. (SF#2053008)


Release 0.70.2 - August 6, 2008
This release fixes some bugs and brings back the Fedora RPM.

Bugs fixed:
- Using the "Save selection" feature together with mail attachments could
  result in data loss.
- Under KDE, the maximized state of the main window would not be restored.
- One couldn't e-mail tasks with non-ASCII characters in their description.
  (SF#2025676)
- Dragging an email message from Thunderbird and dropping it on Task Coach
  could give a "UnicodeDecodeError" on Fedora. (SF#1953166)
- When an invalid regular expression was entered in a search control, no items
  were displayed. Additionally, if it was saved in TaskCoach.ini, TaskCoach
  would crash on launch later.
- Mention of non-existing files in taskcoach.spec prevented the Fedora RPM
  from being built.
- The category viewer would sometimes skip keyboard navigation or need an
  extra mouse-click to get focus. (SF#2020816, SF#2020812)
- On Mac OS X, the keyboard shortcut for 'help' was interfering with the
  shortcut for 'hide window'. (SF#2006455)

Features added:
- Notes can be e-mailed.
- Display a tool tip to warn user when a search string is an invalid regular
  expression. In this case, default to substring search.
- Optionally put Task Coach in the user's startup menu so that Task Coach is
  started automatically when the user logs on (Windows only). (SF#2017400,
  SF#1913650)
- Made (right-click) context menu's more consistent.

Feature removed:
- Don't supply the dummy recipient 'Please enter recipient' to the email
  program when mailing a task. This only forces users to perform an extra
  action to remove that dummy text, while most if not all email programs will
  warn users when they forget to enter a recipient. (SF#2026833)


Release 0.70.1 - June 28, 2008
This release optionally brings back the tabbed user interface that was
removed in the previous release and fixes a few bugs.

Bugs fixed:
- The search control in the toolbar did not maintain state correctly for
  different viewers. Task Coach viewers now each have their own toolbar with
  search control. (SF#1977196)
- Marking tasks completed or changing their priority would change the
  selection. (SF#1888598, SF#1926362)
- On Max OS X, put preferences menu item in the TaskCoach menu instead of the
  Edit menu to conform with Mac OS X standards. (SF#1965861)
- Focus issues: On Mac OS X, text couldn't be edited while the timer was
  running. On Windows, notifications from other programs overlapping with the
  main window would take away focus from dialogs. (SF#1995469, SF#2000152)
- Prevent crash under Windows XP when dropping e-mail from Thunderbird if the
  APPDATA environment variable is not defined. (SF#1960827)
- ImportError: No module named thirdparty.ElementTree. This exception would
  happen when using a source distribution of Task Coach or a package (rpm,
  deb) for Linux *and* when the default version of Python on the system is
  Python 2.4. Task Coach tried to import a module from the wrong package.
  (SF#1964069)
- On Linux, when using a dark theme, use appropriate background colors for
  the category viewer and the text color buttons in the preferences dialog.
  (SF#1988160)
- Remember whether the main window was maximized and if so, maximize the main
  window when starting the next time. (SF#1969266)
- Correctly sort tasks on startup when sort column is 'Overall categories'.
  (SF#1962003)
- Correctly redraw toolbar when it is 'damaged' by other windows (SF#1977208)
- Correctly sort effort for subtasks in effort per day, per week, and per
  month effort viewers. (SF#1989553)
- Better navigation with tab key in dialogs.
- Keep newlines in descriptions when printing or exporting to HTML.

Feature added:
- Task Coach can now use either the old tabbed user interface (whose layout
  still cannot be saved, by the way) or the 'managed frame' interface
  introduced in release 0.70.0. This can be changed in the Preferences dialog.
  (SF#1964213)


Release 0.70.0 - May 12, 2008
Small feature enhancements, more translations and several bug fixes. Task
Coach is now distributed under the GPLv3+.

Bugs fixed:
- Allow for editing seconds in effort editor. (SF#1925748)
- The combobox in the effort detail editor always picked the first task when
  multiple tasks had the same subject, effectively prohibiting the user to
  move an effort record to another task with the same subject. (SF#1918033)
- Reset invalid input in the priority field of the task editor to 0 instead of
  to the minimum priority (a large negative value). (SF#1949222)
- "View->Filter->Reset all filters" now also unchecks all categories.
- Task Coach now is packaged as a proper Debian package, thanks to Stani
  Michiels. The Debian package installs a menu item for Task Coach in the
  Applications/Office menu. (SF#1792706, SF#1792711, SF#1896796)

Features added:
- Paths to file attachments may be relative.
- Monthly recurrence of tasks. (SF#1933222, SF#1957687)
- Added and reorganized keyboard short cuts. (SF#1857101)
- Start tracking effort for any active task using the system tray icon right-
  click menu. (SF#1934738, SF#1739666)
- Added a largely complete Ukranian translation thanks to Vitovt and
  incomplete Finnish, Greek, Persian and Thai translations.

Feature changed:
- Slightly higher preference window so all icons fit and no scrolling is
  needed. (SF#1918678)

Dependencies changed:
- Task Coach now uses Subversion for version control. See
  http://sourceforge.net/svn/?group_id=130831. This only affects you if you
  want to develop or use Task Coach source code.
- Task Coach is now distributed under the GNU General Public License version
  3 or (at your option) any later version. This only affects you if you want
  to distribute changed versions of Task Coach or want to include source code
  from Task Coach in other software.


Release 0.69.2 - March 28, 2008
Bug fix release.

Bugs fixed:
- Tasks created via the context menu of the category view now automatically
  belong to the selected category. (SF#1592103)
- Update task status and colors at midnight. (SF#1183043)
- Exception when starting Task Coach ("AttributeError: 'CategoryList' object
  has no attribute 'EventTypePrefix'"). (SF#1901385)
- Exception when reopening a closed viewer (with the message
  "ConfigParser.NoSectionError: No section: 'effortperdayviewer1'" in the log
  file). (SF#1894488)
- Exception when resetting all filters in the task tree viewer (with the
  message "No option 'hidecompositetasks' in section: 'tasktreelistview'" in
  the log file). (SF#1903679)
- Don't take the priority of completed subtasks into account when calculating
  the overall priority of a task. (SF#1905774)
- It was not clear that backup files can be opened in Task Coach. Backup files
  now have the extension '.tsk.bak'. The file open dialog has '*.tsk.bak' as
  selectable file type to make it easier to open backup files. (SF#1911538)
- Exception when opening the task menu while the toolbar is hidden.

Features added:
- Task Coach now suggests a reminder date, based on the due date or start date
  of a task.
- Added a complete Norwegion Bokmal translation thanks to Amund Amundsen and
  incomplete Galician, Korean and Romanian translations.


Release 0.69.1 - February 14, 2008
Bug fix release.

Bugs fixed:
- Exception when closing a task editor dialog. This causes updates of task
  states not to be displayed properly. The bug itself does not cause data
  loss, but it might trick users into saving an empty task file over their
  existing data. (SF#1893634)
- On Mac OS X, users couldn't enter 'P' and 'M' in text boxes, because these
  were mapped to menu items. Reorganized keyboard shortcuts to fix this.
  (SF#1890566)
- The arrow ('â†’') and infinity symbol ('âˆž') are not visible on
  all computers, so Task Coach is back to using '->' and 'Infinite' again.


Release 0.69.0 - February 9, 2008
This release makes it possible to repeat tasks on either a daily or a weekly
basis and to add notes to categories. It also contains a number of other
changes and bug fixes.

Bugs fixed:
- The reminder dialog didn't close when opening the task from the reminder
  dialog. If the user had entered a snooze option in the reminder dialog, that
  snooze option would be overwritten when closing the task editor.
  (SF#1862286)
- Don't allow filtering by both a parent and a child category at the same
  time.
- Sorting by total categories in the task viewers didn't sort correctly.
- Save didn't work for task files without a file name and without tasks, but
  with categories or notes.
- Adding a task to a category or removing it from a category was not undoable.

Features added:
- Tasks can recur on a daily or weekly basis. This feature is not complete
  yet. Most obviously, recurring on a monthly basis is missing. Also,
  recurring tasks with recurring subtasks do not behave entirely correctly
  yet. (SF#1623364, SF#1464793, SF#1264210)
- Notes can be assigned to categories.
- Added Bulgarian translation, thanks to Rumen Belev.
- Added Danish translation, thanks to different translators.
- Added a number of rather incomplete translations (Italian, Portuguese,
  Swedish, and Turkish). See http://www.taskcoach.org/i18n.html for how you
  can help improve these translations.
- When filtering by one or more categories, new tasks and notes are
  automatically added to those categories. Of course, you can still change the
  categories in the category tab of the edit dialog before pressing the OK
  button.
- Whether descriptions of tasks, effort records, categories and notes are
  shown in a popup tooltip window is now a setting. (SF#1857098)
- Added menu items for increasing, decreasing, maximizing, and minimizing
  task priority. (SF#1768210, SF#1570616)
- Clicking a column header in a task viewer now iterates through the following
  sort orders: 'ascending, after sorting by task status first', 'descending,
  after sorting by task status first', 'ascending, without sorting by task
  status first', 'descending, without sorting by task status first'.

Features changed:
- Previously, unset dates were displayed as 'None' in date columns. To be
  consistent with how other attributes are displayed in columns, Task Coach
  now simply displays nothing for unset dates in date columns.
- Task Coach now uses the infinity symbol ('âˆž') to display the number of
  days left for tasks without a due date, instead of the word 'Infinite'.
- Task Coach now uses a real arrow symbol ('â†’') instead of '->' for
  separating parent and child subjects in the different viewers.

Feature removed:
- Task Coach no longer keeps track of the 'last modification time' of tasks.


Release 0.68.0 - December 26, 2007
This release makes it possible to open a task from its reminder dialog, adds a
command line option to facilitate the PortableApps.com Task Coach
distribution, makes starting and stopping effort tracking quicker and fixes a
number of bugs.

Bugs fixed:
- Start and stop tracking effort is faster for tasks that have a large number
  of associated effort records.
- Task Coach now gives an error message if the file that it tries to open
  doesn't exist. (SF#1857093)
- When selecting all text in a text control with '<cmd>a', indeed select all
  text and not all tasks (Max OSX only). (SF#1857091)
- Attempt to prevent crashes on Fedora 8 that sometimes happen when adding top
  level tasks. (SF#1840111)

Features added:
- It is possible to open a task from its reminder dialog.
- Task Coach has a --ini command line option that can be used to specify where
  the ini file is located.


Release 0.67.0 - December 16, 2007

- Don't move selection to the first line of the task tree viewer when deleting
  a subtask. (SF#1849171)

Features added:
- Added Hebrew translation thanks to Ziv Barcesat.
- You can assign a color to a category. Tasks are colored according to the
  color of the categories they belong to. (SF#1466159, SF#1784932)
- The 'mark task completed' button and menu items can now also be used to
  mark tasks as not completed. (SF#1449714)

Dependency changed:
- Task Coach now needs at least wxPython 2.8.6.0-unicode. Since the Windows
  installer and the Mac OSX dmg package have wxPython included, this only
  affects users of the RPM, Debian, and source distributions.


Release 0.66.3 - December 11, 2007
Bug fix release to address crashes.

  needing to install ElementTree. (SF#1783575)

Features added:
- Notes. Notes have a subject and an optional description. Notes can be
  hierarchical, i.e. notes may contain subnotes. Notes can be sorted and
  searched (filtered), printed, and exported. This feature can be turned on or

  toolbar.
- Category sorting can be changed: ascending or descending, case sensitive or
  case insensitive.
- Categories can have a description.
- Each viewer/tab has its own settings for sort order and visible columns.
  Viewers can be renamed. This makes it possible to e.g. create a 'Todo
  today'.
- The search control on the toolbar can (optionally) include subitems in the
  search result. This makes it easy to show one task and its subtasks in a
  task viewer or show effort for one task and its subtasks in an effort
  viewer.

  translations and on how you can help.


Release 0.64.2 - June 30, 2007
This release fixes sorting of tasks by priority and makes sure that Task Coach
does not block OS shutdown.

Bugs fixed:
- Don't take child task priority into account when sorting by priority in the
  task tree view. (SF#1732968)
- Don't block OS shutdown on Windows. (SF#1735532, SF#1484652, SF#1489870)


Release 0.64.1 - June 10, 2007

- Task Coach would complain about an error when closing the application. This
  was due to a missing package in the Windows executable distribution.
  (SF#1727237)
- On Linux, Task Coach was not very helpful when the taskcoachlib package is
  installed for a different python version than the one the user is starting
  Task Coach with. (SF#1728485)


Release 0.64.0 - May 28, 2007

Bugs fixed:
- Ubuntu users had to manually install the wxaddons package. This package is
  now included in the Task Coach distribution.
- Don't hide the main window when it's iconized by default because on Linux
  with some window managers the main window receives minimize events in other
  situations as well, most notably when changing virtual desktops. So, to
  reduce the chances of confusing new users this option is off by default.
  (SF#1721166)

Features added:
- Added Breton translation thanks to Ronan Le DÃ©roff
- Show a tooltip with a task's description when the mouse is hovering over a
  task. Patch provided by Jérôme Laheurte. (SF#1642608, SF#1619521,
  SF#1578623)
- Allow for dragging emails from Thunderbird and Outlook to the attachment
  pane of tasks to create email attachments. Opening an attached email will
  open it in the user's default mail program. Patch provided by Jérôme
  Laheurte.


Release 0.63.2 - April 20, 2007

Bug fixed:
- Task tree view does not refresh tasks after task editing. (SF#1701368)


Release 0.63.1 - April 16, 2007

Bugs fixed:
- Dropping a file on a task in the tree viewer didn't work.
- Showing the description column in the composite effort viewers (effort per
  day, per week, per month) caused exceptions.
- The task tree viewer was trying to update tasks that weren't shown,
  resulting in exceptions. (SF#1697568, SF#1697574)


Release 0.63.0 - April 9, 2007

Bugs fixed:
- Cancelling printing would give a 'Task Coach Error'
- Make sure the main window is on a visible display when starting. This is
  for laptop users that sometimes extend their desktop to a second display.
  (SF#1667120)
- Sort categories alphabetically in the categories viewer. (SF#1694532)
- Filtering a category no longer automatically checks all subcategories.
  However, tasks belonging to a subcategory are still filtered (since they
  belong to the filtered category via the subcategory).

Features added:
- Export to HTML and printing of tasks colors tasks appropriately.
- Added description columns to the task and effort viewers. Like other
  columns, the description column is printed and exported if visible.
- Added reminder column to the task viewers.


Release 0.62.0 - April 1, 2007

Bugs fixed:
- When saving timestamps in a task file, e.g. for effort start and stop times,
  microseconds are no longer saved as part of the timestamp. The microseconds
  caused problems when importing Task Coach data in Excel. (SF#1660670)
- When exporting tasks to HTML or CSV format from the task tree viewer, child
  tasks hidden by a filter would still be exported. (SF#1659307)

Features added:
- Added Slovak translation thanks to Viliam BÃºr
- Printing a selection is enabled (except on Mac OSX).
- The notebook that contains the different views allows for dragging and
  dropping of tabs, enabling you to create almost any layout you like.
  Unfortunately, this widget does not yet provide functionality to store the
  layout in the TaskCoach.ini file.
- Whether the clock icon in the task bar blinks or not is now a setting (see
  Edit -> Preferences -> Window behavior.
- The toolbar buttons for 'new item', 'new sub item', 'edit item' and 'delete
  item' now work for tasks, effort records and categories, depending on what
  view is active.
- Added a category column for task viewers. (SF#1629283)
- Added an attachment column that shows whether a task has one or more
  attachments.
- Added an 'Open all attachments' menu item for tasks

  are now available via the search filter on the toolbar, the category tab and
  the view menu.

Dependency changed:
- Task Coach now requires wxPython 2.8.3-unicode or newer (this is only
  relevant if you use the source distribution).


Release 0.61.6 - January 27, 2007

Bugs fixed:
- Crash on trying to use down-arrow to move to sub-task. (SF#1640806)
- When deleting a task that has subtasks that belong to categories, the task
  file gets 'corrupted', giving errors when loading it. (SF#1638419,
  SF#1589993)


Release 0.61.5 - January 10, 2007

Bug fixed:
- Opening a Task Coach file with many effort records is slow. Opening an edit
  dialog for a task with many effort records is slow too. (SF#1630102)


Release 0.61.4 - December 30, 2006

Bugs fixed:
- Make Task Coach work with Python 2.5.
- Cancel reminders when marking a task completed. (SF#1606990)
- Unchecking a reminder would cause an exception. (SF#1606990)
- Column resizing is now less jumpy. (SF#1606319)
- MSVCP71.DLL was missing from the Windows distribution. (SF#1602364)
- Marking a task completed while completed tasks are hidden wouldn't
  immediately hide the completed task. (SF#1572920)
- The category filter was not applied correctly on launch; showing categories
  as filtered but not hiding the associated tasks. (SF#1603846)
- Turning on filtering for a category didn't mark the task file as changed.
  (SF#1603846)

Feature added:
- Added RPM and Debian distributions.


Release 0.61.3 - November 19, 2006

Bugs fixed:
- If saving the TaskCoach.ini file would fail, displaying the error message
  would fail (too) because the i18n translator had not been imported at that
  point. (SF#1598568)
- Mac OSX distribution did not start. Upgraded py2app. (SF#1594190)
- Dragging and dropping a task in the task tree view would sometimes drag the
  wrong task.
- Give category dialog focus and select default category title to make it
  easier to quickly enter categories using the keyboard.
- The gdiplus.dll was missing from the Windows distribution. (SF#1596843)


Release 0.61.2 - November 11, 2006

Bugs fixed:
- Some Linux distributions do not have the BROWSER environment variable set,
  causing errors. Be prepared. (SF#1567244)
- Saving failed with a UnicodeError if a category description would contain

Bug fixed:
- Source distribution was missing some files.


Release 0.61.0 - November 2, 2006

  window. (SF#1551885)
- Exported HTML didn't contain an explicit charset. (SF#1561490)
- Negative effort preventation was not working correctly. (SF#1575458)

Features added:
- Hierarchical categories.
- Export in Comma Separated Values (CSV) format. As with export to HTML, the
  current view is exported. (SF#1534862)
- Task Coach can be run from a removable medium, such as a USB stick. On
  Windows, use the installer to install Task Coach to the medium. Then, start
  Task Coach and turn the setting 'Save settings to same directory as
  program' on. This setting can be found in Edit -> Preferences -> File).
  This makes sure the TaskCoach.ini file is saved on the removable medium, in
  the same directory as the main program. (SF#1464435)


Release 0.60 - August 30, 2006

Bugs fixed:
- Closing a task file did not reset the 'lastfile' setting. (SF#1548126)

  (SF#1545593)
- Task Coach wouldn't quit when the setting 'Minimize window when closing' was

Release 0.59 - August 23, 2006

Bugs fixed:
- Improved efficiency while tracking effort for tasks. (SF#1429545)
- The column width of the list with filenames in the attachment page of the
  task editor is now adaptable, so that long filenames can be made visible
  entirely. (SF#1503006)
- Translation errors in tips. (SF#1525410, SF#1525423)
- When having multiple tasks with the same subject, new effort records would
  always be created for the first of these tasks instead of the selected task.
  (SF#1513403, SF#1524037)
- Opening a file with a non-ascii filename specified on the command line did
  not work. (SF#1532528)

Features added:
- Japanese translation thanks to Yutaka Usui.
- Filter sidebar.
- Printing. Selecting 'File' -> 'Print' will print the currently active view.
  This means only the visible columns will be printed and only the filtered
  tasks will be printed, in the current sort order. (SF#1481881, SF#1472662,
  SF#1307275, SF#1205819)
- Export to HTML. Selecting 'File' -> 'Export' -> 'Export to HTML' will export
  the currently active view to HTML. This means only the visible columns will
  be exported and only the filtered tasks will be printed, in the current sort
  order. (SF#1375773, SF#1205819)
- Columns with numbers or dates are right-aligned.


Release 0.58 - May 14, 2006

Bugs fixed:
- On Mac OSX, Task Coach would seg fault upon exiting.
- Right-clicking a task in the task tree view would, correctly, pop up the
  context menu, but would not select the underlying task. (SF#1440416)
- The memory leak in the TreeListCtrl was fixed in wxPython 2.6.3.2. The
  installer for Windows and the disk image for Mac OSX use wxPython 2.6.3.2,
  thus fixing the memory leak in Task Coach. If you use the source
  distribution of Task Coach you will have to install wxPython 2.6.3.2
  yourself to get the fix. (SF#1309858)
- Filtering on task categories was improved.
- Hitting Delete when editing the text in the find dialog would delete any
  selected tasks. Unfortunately, to fix this bug some accelerators had to be
  changed: the accelerator for "Delete task" is now Ctrl-Delete, for "New
  task" it is now Ctrl-Insert, and for "New subtask" it is now Shift-Ctrl-
  Insert. (SF#1463316)
- Don't close the current file when user cancels opening another file.
  (SF#1475473)

Features added:
- Added toolbar button for 'new subtask'.
- Task Coach searches incrementally as you type a query in the find bar.
- When dragging a task in the tree view, hover over a tree button (a boxed
  plus-sign or a triangle, depending on your platform) to expand the sub tree.
- To promote a sub task to a top-level task in the tree view, drag it and drop
  it anywhere as long as it is not on another task.
- When filtering tasks by multiple categories, you may either choose to view
  tasks that belong to at least one of the selected categories, or view tasks
  that belong to all selected categories.


Release 0.57 - March 16, 2006

Bugs fixed:
- When adding a new effort to a task, take into account that the user may have
  changed the task that the effort belongs to in the effort editor dialog
  (using the dropdown combobox). Because Task Coach didn't do that, the effort
  would be added twice if the user changed the task of the new effort record.
  (SF#1443906)
- A file that was saved with an active effort couldn't be loaded again. Task
  Coach would complain that the file was invalid. (SF#1433611)
- Added different sizes of the Task Coach icon. This prevents scaling up the
  16x16 version to 32x32 on Windows or to even 128x128 on the Mac.
  (SF#1406651, SF#1434044)

Feature added:
- Task Coach is now also available as disk image (.dmg) for Mac OSX (tested on
  OSX 10.4).


Release 0.56 - February 14, 2006

Features added:
- Tasks can have attachments. Attachments can be added, removed and opened.
  Opening of attachments is done by starting the default application for the
  attachment file type. Attachments can also be dragged from a file browser
  and dropped onto a task in one of the task viewers or on the task
  attachment pane in the task editor dialog. (SF#1250241, SF#1339113)
- Whether a task is marked completed when all its child tasks are completed is
  now a setting that can be changed application-wide via the preferences
  dialog. The application-wide setting can be overruled on a task-by-task
  basis via the task editor dialog. (SF#1393803)
- Task Coach shows a 'tips' dialog at startup. Hopefully it is helpful for new
  users. Experienced users can turn it off.

Features changed:
- More visual feedback when dragging tasks in the tree view.
- Task editor layout changed. Priority is now part of the task description.
  Budget and revenue have been merged into one pane. (SF#1312284)

Implementation changed:
- Default values for task and effort attributes are no longer saved in the
  Task Coach file, resulting in an estimated 33%% reduction of file size.


Release 0.55 - January 13, 2006

Bug fixed:
- Sorting by total budget was broken. (SF#1399116)

Feature added:
- Simple reminders. (SF#1372932)

Dependency changed:
- Task Coach now requires wxPython 2.6.1.0-unicode or newer (this is only
  relevant if you use the source distribution).


Release 0.54 - January 6, 2006

Bugs fixed:
- The accelerators INSERT and Ctrl+INSERT were mapped to 'c' and 'Command-
  Copy' on the Mac, which caused Task Coach to create a new task whenever the
  user typed a 'c'. Fixed by changing the accelerators for new task and new
  subtask to Ctrl+N and Shift+Ctrl+N (on the Mac only). (SF#1311413)
- It was possible to enter control characters -- by copy-and-pasting --
  resulting in invalid XML in the Task Coach file. (SF#1288689)
- One python file was missing in the source distribution of release 0.53.
  Added a test to check that all python files in the source are actually added
  to the source distributions, so hopefully this will never happen again.
  (SF#1389224)

Feature added:
- Effort can be exported as iCalendar (ICS) file and imported into e.g.
  Mozilla Sunbird. Each effort record is exported as a "VEVENT". This is an
  experimental feature. Patch provided by Gissehel.


Release 0.53 - December 19, 2005

Bugs fixed:
- On some platforms, Python and wxPython seem to disagree on what the maximum
  integer is. The maximum integer is used to set the maximum and minimum
  allowed priority values. Fixed by allowing priority values between the
  rather arbitrary minimum and maximum values of -1000000000 and 1000000000.
- Fixed exception: "wx._core.PyAssertionError: C++ assertion "ucf.GotUpdate()"
  failed in ..\..\src\msw extctrl.cpp(813): EM_STREAMIN didn't send
  EN_UPDATE?". This seems to be a bug in wxPython 2.6.0 and 2.6.1. Patch
  provided by Franz Steinhaeusler. (SF#1344023)

Features added:
- Columns in the effort view are hideable too, just like columns in the task
  views. See 'View' -> 'Effort columns', or right-click a column header in the
  effort view.
- Added possibility to mail tasks via your default mailer, see 'Task' ->
  'Mail task' or right-click a task in one of the task views.
- Added option to minimize the window when you attempt to close the
  application via the close button on the window title bar or the system
  menu. See 'Edit' -> 'Preferences' -> 'Window behavior'.


Release 0.52 - November 29, 2005

Bugs fixed:
- For completed tasks, the number of days left for a task is now the number
  of days between the completion date and the due date. This prevents that
  the number of days left of completed tasks keeps decreasing, i.e. becoming
  more negative. For uncompleted tasks, the number of days left is still the
  number of days between today and the due date, of course. Patch provided by
  Maciej Malycha.
- Put taskocachlib package first on the Python search path to prevent name
  conflict with the config module on Gentoo Linux. (SF#1353636)
- Mention blue icon in the help on task colors. (SF#1355985)
- Don't allow empty categories. (SF#1333896)

Features added:
- Tasks can be dragged and dropped. (SF#1262863)
- Tasks can have an hourly fee and/or a fixed fee. Revenue is calculated based
  on effort spent. (SF#1361790)
- First tiny steps towards a user manual, see 'Help' -> 'Help contents'.
- Whether the main window hides itself when iconized is now adjustable
  behavior. See 'Edit' -> 'Preferences'.

Feature changed:
- Backups are created just before saving, instead of when loading a .tsk
  file. Patch provided by Maciej Malycha.

Feature removed:
- Files in the old comma-separated format can no longer be read by Task Coach.


Release 0.51 - October 30, 2005

Bugs fixed:
- Hitting enter in the find dialog didn't work on Linux.
- Old TaskCoach.ini files with a language setting of 'en' instead of 'en_US'
  or 'en_GB' would cause an exception. Patch provided by Nirendra Maharaj.

Features added:
- Escape closes pop-up windows. Patch provided by Markus Meyer. (SF#1241547)
- The task of an effort record can be changed.
- Effort records can be cut, copied, and pasted.


Release 0.50 - October 2, 2005

Bug fixed:
- Exception was thrown when opening a task with logged effort.


Release 0.49 - October 2, 2005

Bug fixed:
- Previous release did not work on Linux/Mac OSX because of a platform
  inconsistency between Windows and Linux (GetCountPerPage method is missing
  on Linux, added manually). (SF#1305457)

Feature added:
- Task colors can be adjusted via 'Edit' -> 'Preferences'. (SF#1205579)


Release 0.48 - September 24, 2005

Bugs fixed:
- Filtering tasks by status ('View' -> 'Tasks that are' -> '...') would cause
  an exception.
- Sorting by days left would cause an exception. (SF#1295122)


Release 0.47 - September 18, 2005

Bugs fixed:
- 'View'->'All tasks' now also resets any search criterium entered by the user
  in the search bar.
- When opening a task with a (long) description, the cursor will be positioned
  on the first line of the text, instead of on the last line. (SF#1265845)
- When viewing tasks due before a certain date in the tree view, tasks with
  subtasks due before that date will be visible. (SF#1275708)

Features added:
- Added Hungarian translation thanks to Majsa Norbert.
- The task tree view now also shows columns with task details, similar to the
  task list view. (SF#1194642)
- Sorting on task subject can now also be case insensitive. See the menu item
  'View' -> 'Sort' -> 'Sort case sensitive'. (SF#1228873)
- Recent files are remembered and can be opened from the File menu. The
  maximum number of recent files shown can be set in the Preferences dialog.
  Set the maximum to zero to disable this feature. (SF#1191707)
- The last modification time of tasks can be viewed.


Release 0.46 - August 12, 2005

Bugs fixed:
- In the effort views, the status bar would show information about tasks, not
  about effort.
- Entering a negative effort duration while using a non-english language
  would crash Task Coach. (SF#1250177)
- Having a two letter language string (e.g. 'en') in the TaskCoach.ini file
  would cause an error in the preferences dialog. (SF#1247506)

Features added:
- Double-clicking the system tray icon when Task Coach is not minimized will
  raise the Task Coach window. (SF#1242520)
- Added Spanish translation thanks to Juan JosÃ©.

Feature changed:
- Keyboard shortcut for deleting a task is now 'Delete' instead of 'Ctrl-D'
  and 'Ctrl-Enter' marks the selected task(s) completed. (SF#1241549)

Implementations changed:
- Task ids are now persistent, i.e. they are saved to and loaded from the Task
  Coach (XML) file. This will make it easier, in the future, to keep tasks
  synchronized with external sources, e.g. Outlook.
- Task Coach now keeps track of the last modification time of tasks. These
  times are saved to and loaded from the Task Coach (XML) file. This change is
  also in preparation of synchronization functionality.


Release 0.45 - July 26, 2005

Bugs fixed:
- When tracking effort the task file would be marked as changed after every
  clock tick.
- Task priority can now be set to both positive and negative integers.
- Opening a help dialog before the splash screen disappeared would make Task
  Coach stop responding to input. Fixed by making the helpdialogs modeless (as
  they should be). (SF#1241058)

Feature changed:
- Setting the start date of a subtask earlier than the start date of the
  parent task, or setting the due date of a subtask later than the due date of
  the parent task will adapt the parent start or due date as necessary.
  (SF#1237634)

  sort order.


Release 0.42 - July 17, 2005

Bugs fixed:
- Double clicking a task with children in the tree view would open the edit
  dialog and expand or collapse the task as well. Fixed to not collapse or

- Adding a subtask to a collapsed parent task now automatically expands the
  parent task.
- Changing the description of a task or effort record wouldn't mark the task

  Schroeder.
- (Windows installer only) Association between .tsk files and Task Coach was
  broken.

Feature changed:

  allowed (SF#1194527, SF#1194567, SF#1210154)

Features changed:
- Default start date of new subtasks is today (used to be the start date of
  the parent task)
- When 'sort by status first' is on, active tasks always come before inactive
  tasks which in turn come before completed tasks, regardless of whether the

  budget, etc.) This includes options to sort ascending or descending and to
  first sort by status (active/inactive/completed).

- A unittest.py bug that was fixed in Python 2.4 revealed a bug in test.py.
  (SF#1181714)
- When searching for a task that is completed, while the 'show completed'
  switch is off, the search shows the path to the task (i.e. parent tasks),
  but not the matched task itself. (SF#1182528)
- When searching for tasks in the tree view, composite tasks are expanded
  automatically to show the children that match the search string.
  (SF#1182528)
- Columns were hidden by setting their width to 0, but that did not make them
  entirely invisible on some Linux platforms. (SF#1152566)

  (SF#1179266)

Features added:
- In the task list and effort list the task column is automatically resized
  to take up the available space.

  choices in the main window and the effort choices in the task editor.
  (SF#1178779)

- Effort per day, per week and per month view now also show total time spent
  (i.e. time including time spent on subtasks).


Release 0.24 - March 10, 2005

Bugs fixed:
- Saving a selection of tasks to a separate file would also save all effort
  records to that file (instead of just the effort records for the selected
  tasks), giving errors when loading that file.
- Deleting a task with effort records would not delete the effort records.

Feature added:
- The tracking status of tasks is saved. So if you start tracking a task,
  quit Task Coach, and restart Task Coach later, effort for that task is
  still being tracked. Requested by Bob Hossley.


Release 0.23 - February 20, 2005

Bug fixed:
- Fixed a couple of bugs in the unit tests, discovered by Stephen Boulet and
  Jérôme Laheurte on the Linux platform.


Release 0.22 - February 17, 2005

Bugs fixed:
- In the effort summary view, effort spent on a task in the same month or week
  but in different years would erroneously be added. E.g. effort in January
  2004 and January 2006 would be added.
- The mechanism to prevent effort periods with a negative duration (i.e. a
  start time later than the stop time) in the effort editor was invoked on
  each key stroke which caused inconvenient behavior. Fixed it by only
  invoking it when the user leaves the text or combo box.

Features added:
- Added possibility to start tracking effort for a task, with start time
  equal to the end time of the previous effort period. This is for example
  convenient if you stop working on a task and then spend some time deciding
  on what to do next. This is the 'Start tracking from last stop time' menu
  item in the 'Effort' menu.
- (Re)Added the unittests to the source distribution. See INSTALL.txt.
- Export to XML. Currently limited to tasks, effort is not exported yet.


Release 0.21 - February 9, 2005

Bugs fixed:
- Setting the start date/time in the effort editor would change the stop
  date/time while not strictly necessary to prevent negative durations.
- Refreshing the virtual ListCtrl failed under
  wxPython2.5-gtk2-unicode-2.5.3.1-fc2_py2.3 and wxPython-common-
  gtk2-unicode-2.5.3.1-fc2_py2.3. Reported by Stephen Boulet.
- After iconizing the main window for a second time, the icon in the task bar
  wouldn't be hidden anymore. Reported and fixed by Jérôme Laheurte.


Release 0.20 - February 6, 2005

Bugs fixed:
- Reading .tsk files version 2 failed.
- Completed child tasks were not hidden in the tree view when 'View->Completed
  tasks' was on.
- Hiding the find panel did not clear the search filter.
- When searching for tasks, not all matches were shown in the tree view.
- Displaying time spent and total time spent in the list view for more than a
  dozen tasks and efforts was slow. Used caching to speed it up.
- Tool tips on the toolbar included mnemonics and accelerator characters on
  Linux. Reported on python-2.3.4 and
  wxPython2.5-gtk2-unicode-2.5.3.1-fc2_py2.3 on Suse 9.2 by Stephen Boulet.

Features added:
- Effort can be viewed summarized per day, per week, and per month.
- Effort for a specific task can be viewed (and edited) in the task editor.

- Size and position of the main window are saved in the settings and restored
  on the next session. This also includes whether the main window is iconized
  or not.
- Splash screen can be turned off.
