lie between the dates of its parent task. Previously, if the start date of a

Task Coach would silently make the start of the parent task equal to the 
start date of the child task. The same for the due date: setting the due
date of the parent task earlier than the due date of a child task would 
silently change the due date of the child tasks if their due date would 
otherwise become later than the due date of the parent task.

When viewing tasks in the task tree viewer, collapsing a task with child tasks 
will show recursive dates when relevant. This means that the planned start 
date column will show the earliest start date of the task itself and all of
its child tasks. If the earliest start date is the start date of one of the 
child tasks, the date will be shown between brackets. Likewise, the actual 
start date column will show the earliest actual start date of the task and all 
of its child tasks. The due date column and the completion date column will 
show the latest date of the parent and child tasks combined. 

When sorting on a date column, the recursive value is used for sorting. So when
sorting ascending by due date a parent task without due date but with a child
task due today will sort before a task that is due tomorrow.
